        # We need to check if the array can be reduced to all zeros
        # by applying the allowed operations
        # The key observation is that the operation allows us to decrease
        # the first k elements or the last k elements by 1 each time.
        # This is equivalent to being able to decrease any prefix or suffix
        # of the array by any amount (as long as we do it in steps of 1).
        # Therefore, the problem reduces to checking if the array can be
        # reduced to all zeros by subtracting some values from the prefix
        # and suffix.
